# Credit-Card-Spending-Analysis
Created a dynamic Power BI dashboard that visualise customer credit card spending habit in India in a given period. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view into the spending habits of customers using credit cards across different regions in India.
Insight from this project will assist businesses to analyse customer trends and interest by looking at the type of purchases made based on their gender and city. It will also help to detect potential credit card fraud or malicious activities such as change in spending or unusual purchases.
